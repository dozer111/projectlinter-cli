  - "We use both libraries for now"
  - "And it is more and more harder to maintain both of them in services"
  - "So we decided to drop easyjson, and use only faster gojay instead"
  - "The switch is not so easy."
  - "You need to generate new gojay code via https://github.com/francoispqt/gojay/tree/master/gojay"
  - "There must be tests on the structures. If it is absent - add"
